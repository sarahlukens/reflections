What are the pros and cons of Gits automatic merging vs always doing merges manually?

Pros:
It automatically finds conflicts and points out where they happen
Often, a code base can be so large that a change in one area of it will only help the whole thing holistically, and this is probably the most common use case

Cons:
Anything automatic is done automatically, which means funny things may happen

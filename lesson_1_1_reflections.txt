 How did viewing a diff between 2 versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

1. It limited the lines to look at, I only had to look at the ones that were different
2. Once I looked at what was changed, I looked at what was funny, which was pretty clear
3. I was really happy the course didn't ask for "line number", because that wasn't there in the diff output

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have 1 commit per logical change?

You can use the git diff functions!  Git diff with no argument shows what it's in the staging area compared to the working direction, and git diff --staged shows what will be added with a commit.  When you run git diff --staged, you should review the differences to make sure there is one logical theme.
